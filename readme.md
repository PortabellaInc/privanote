## PrivaNote, offline first, end-to-end encrypted notes

Thanks for checking out PrivaNote! We're glad to have you here.

PrivaNote (like the name suggests) is a private note taking application. You can load it at [privanote.xyz](https://privanote.xyz) or for power users, replace your browsers "new tab" window with PrivaNote via our extensions:

- [PrivaNote for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privanote-extension/bmpjebghajghighjhanphoekfenjkeao?hl=en&authuser=0)
- [PrivaNote for Firefox (coming soon)]()

That way PrivaNote is only a quick CMD (or CTRL) + N away for jotting down notes.
